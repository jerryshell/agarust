- Use the mouse to control the direction of movement
- Press the left mouse button to sprint
  - Sprinting drops 20% of your mass
  - Players with too little mass can't sprint
- You can only eat another player if the difference in mass is greater than 1.5 times
- The player's mass will slowly drop over time, the higher the mass, the higher the chance of dropping
- The formula for converting mass to radius: `Mass = PI * Radius * Radius`
